            <h3>Hey there, welcome to my website!</h3>
            <p>
                So about me... well I am a <strong>sophomore at Manipal University Jaipur pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science</strong>. Since a young age, I have always been fascinated by the technology and machinery around me, from personal computers, to desktops, to even cars at times and how things work in general. Okay, maybe not just work but whats inside those machine so i, on most occasions, ended up breaking electronic gadgets just to satisfy my curiosity regarding these.
            </p>
            <p>
                MY first year of college went pretty well, where I had to study the basic engineering subjects common to all departments. Being a fresher, i had attended several workshops organised by our college clubs and since then have been enthralled by the technology and motivated to keep exploring my field of study.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coming back to my second year, I am currently in my Fourth Semester after tedious but interesting Third Semester that has taught me various courses like Computer Systems and Architecture, Data Structures, Networks and Object Oriented Programming. The major languages used were C and Java. I also took the opportunity to build a minor project 'WeRec' using Java, JSON, API, and SQLite to build a weather forecasting project that runs on the terminal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I have had this urge to engage myself with learning about <strong>Artificial intelligence and Machine learning</strong> as i think this skill can be a cherry-on-top with my existing skill-set which includes Python, Java, Flask, Django, SQL, SQLite, C, a little bit of C++, and Web Development. I have recently received a 3-star ranking on HackerRank Problem Solving and a 4-star rating in HackerRank C Programming. However, I think its the knowledge gained and experiences grasped that plays an important role in becoming the best version of yourself as it is always going to be you who shall competing with yourself to get to the best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being a Computer Science student, i think it is important for me to gain new skills obviously; but apart from that, it's the knowledge, and the soft-skills that matter the most as these are the ones that shall be handy through the different phases of college, or company,or perhaps, life in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well this is me, <strong>Abhijeet Rajhans</strong>, and with this note, I wish the reader the very best for their future and maybe - lets connect!
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence in a nutshell, as a computer science sophomore, I am eager to learn and grow as a programmer. I am
                highly motivated and committed to achieving excellence in my studies and future career. My computer science
                and engineering coursework has already introduced me to a wide range of topics including programming
                languages, data structures, and algorithms. I am excited to continue learning and expanding my skill-set to
                become a well-rounded and proficient software developer. In the future, I plan to use my skills and
                knowledge to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact in the field of computer science.
