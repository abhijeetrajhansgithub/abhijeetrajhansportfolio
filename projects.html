    <h2>CityRanker Project</h2>
    <p>🚀 Exciting Announcement: Introducing CityRanker Project! 🌆</p>
    <p>Thrilled to unveil CityRanker, an innovative platform engaging users in choosing between two cities. Inspired by "The Social Network," CityRanker transforms competition and comparison into a user-friendly experience, allowing individuals to express preferences and explore cities uniquely.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>How does it work? 🤖🌐</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Picture Selection:</strong> Users are presented with random pictures of two cities. Their task is to choose between the two.</li>
        <li><strong>Vote Storage:</strong> User choices are stored in a database, where votes are meticulously recorded for further analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Vote Dynamics:</strong> The interactions and dynamics of the pictures, along with the accumulated votes, play a crucial role in shaping the predictions made by the underlying model.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Prediction:</strong> The model processes the collected votes and image dynamics to make predictions about city preferences based on user choices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        CityRanker operates through a simple yet engaging process, incorporating machine learning to add intelligence to city comparisons. Developed in Python, CityRanker boasts an intuitive GUI using Tkinter, ensuring seamless navigation for users. The project took 4-5 months for development, starting in August 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Machine Learning Integration 🌲:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        CityRanker differentiates itself by integrating machine learning, adding intelligence to city comparisons. Leveraging the RandomForestClassifier, the machine learning component uses decision trees during training, contributing to accuracy and reliability in city comparisons. The RandomForestClassifier consistently achieves an accuracy rate exceeding 85%, grounding user choices in a robust machine-learning model and adding credibility to the entire interaction.
    </p>
